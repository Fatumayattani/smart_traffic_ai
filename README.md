## Project Overview

The objective of SmartTraffic AI is to leverage AI-driven models to enhance transportation efficiency by providing actionable insights based on real-time traffic patterns. By integrating data such as current traffic congestion, weather conditions, and incidents, SmartTraffic AI delivers brief, informative recommendations aimed at reducing travel time and minimizing congestion.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Traffic Prediction**: Generates predictive insights based on current traffic, weather, and incident reports.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Provides actionable suggestions, helping users select the best routes during peak traffic hours.
- **Dynamic Loading Indicators**: A user-friendly interface with responsive loading animations to keep users informed during analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures reliable usage with messages to alert users when insights are unavailable.

## AI Model

SmartTraffic AI is powered by Google’s Generative AI (Gemini model), using a natural language processing approach to generate meaningful insights. This AI model analyzes context provided in prompts to output actionable traffic insights.

## How It Works
SmartTraffic AI’s insights are generated in the following way:

- **Data Collection**: The tool considers predefined traffic conditions such as congestion, weather, and incidents.
- **AI Processing**: Using a prompt fed into Google’s Gemini AI model, the application generates a brief traffic prediction and recommendations.
- **Result Display**: The generated insight is presented to the user through a clean, user-friendly interface.
